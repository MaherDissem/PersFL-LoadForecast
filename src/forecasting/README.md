Train and evaluate a time series forecasting model given forecasting parameters like the sequence size, forecast horizon, etc., and model architecture specific parameters.

The models we experiment with are:

- Seq2seq: a GRU-based seq2seq model for time series forecasting.

- [SCINet](https://github.com/cure-lab/SCINet): a recursive downsample-convolve-interact architecture.
